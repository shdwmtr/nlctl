# nlctl
**N**ano**L**eaf-**C**on**T**ro**L**

A simple, standalone, cross platform controller for Nanoleaf PC Screen Mirror LS

## Why?

As you may already know, to control the light strip from your PC, you must rely on Nanoleafs proprietary software. 
This software is not only bulky and filled with paid services, but it also doesn't natively support linux. 

This project addresses this discrepancy.
